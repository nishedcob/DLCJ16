Operand Read Types:
Immediate - All 12 bit operands are numbers (constants)
Variable - 12 bit operand determines mode of operand(s) that follow as 4 bit segments (Source 1, Source 2, Destination):
	0x0 - Do not use operand, uses the following logic based on operand configuration:
		0x000 -> use stack
		0x00? -> use stack, save result to destination
		0x0?0 -> use stack, source 2, save to stack
		0x0?? -> use stack, source 2, save to destination
		0x?00 -> use source 1, stack, save to stack
		0x?0? -> use source 1, stack, save result to destination
		0x??0 -> use source 1, source 2, save to stack
		0x??? -> use source 1, source 2, save to destination
	0x1 - Data 1 (Accumulator)
	0x2 - Data 2
	0x3 - Data 3
	0x4 - Data 4
	0x5 - Instruction Pointer
	0x6 - Data Pointer
	0x7 - Stack Pointer
	0x8 - Pointer Auxiliar
	0x9 - Instruction Segment
	0xA - Data Segment
	0xB - Stack Segment
	0xC - Modos Register 
	0xD - Flags Register
	0xE - Memory Address
	0xF - Immediate
Counter - 12 bit es un operando para el numero de veces que debe repetir para la instrucci√≥n de la pila.

Operand Interpret Types
Data Direct - Value is read as Value [ALL]
Single Address - Value is read as Address of the Value [ALL]
Double Address - Value is read as Address of the Address of the Value [SOURCES ONLY]
